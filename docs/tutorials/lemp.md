Working with LEMP
=================

Lando offers a [configurable recipe](./../recipes/lemp.md) for spinning up apps that use the [LEMP](https://lemp.io/) stack, a popular [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) variant that replaces the `apache` webserver with `nginx`.

Note that you'll only want to use this recipe if you have a custom PHP application not supported by one of Lando's other recipes. Let's go over some basic usage.

<!-- toc -->

Getting Started
---------------

Before you get started with this recipe we assume that you have:

1. [Installed Lando](./../installation/system-requirements.md)
2. [Read up on how to get a `.lando.yml`](./../started.md)

If after reading #2 above you are still unclear how to get started then try this

```bash
# Go into a local folder with your site or app codebase
# You can get this via git clone or from an archive
cd /path/to/my/codebase

# Initialize a basic .lando.yml file for my recipe with sane defaults
lando init

# Commit the .lando.yml to your git repo (Optional but recommended)
git add -A
git commit -m "MAKE LOCAL DEV GREAT AGAIN"
git push
```

For more info on how `lando init` works check out [this](./../cli/init.md).

Starting Your Site
------------------

Once you've completed the above you should be able to start your LEMP site.

```bash
# Start up app
lando start

# Optionally run composer install if needed
lando composer install
```

If you visit any of the green-listed URLS that show up afterwards you should be presented with whatever content is rendered by your `index.php`.

Importing Your Database
-----------------------

If you have an existing database for your application, you can easily import it done using our helpful `lando db-import` command.

```bash
# Go into my app
cd /path/to/my/app

# Grab your database dump
curl -fsSL -o database.sql.gz "https://url.to.my.db/database.sql.gz"

# Import the database
# NOTE: db-import can handle uncompressed, gzipped or zipped files
lando db-import database.sql.gz --database=lemp
```

You can learn more about the `db-import` command [over here](./db-import.md).

Tooling
-------

Each LAMP recipe will also ship with some helpful php dev utilities. This means you can use things like `composer` and `php-cli` via Lando and avoid mucking up your actual computer trying to manage `php` versions and tooling.

```bash
lando composer                 Run composer commands
lando db-import <file>         Import <file> into database. File is relative to approot.
lando db-export                Export a database. Resulting file: {DB_NAME}.TIMESTAMP.gz
lando mysql|pgsql              Drops into either a MySQL or Postgres shell depending on what DB you use
lando php                      Run php commands
```

```bash
# Run composer install
lando composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

# Drop into a mysql shell
lando mysql

# Check the app's php version
lando php -v
```

You can also run `lando` from inside your app directory for a complete list of commands.

Configuration
-------------

### Recipe

You can also manually configure the `.lando.yml` file to switch `php` versions, toggle between `apache` and `nginx`, activate `xdebug`, choose a database type and version, set a custom webroot locaton and use your own configuration files.

{% codesnippet "./../examples/lemp2/.lando.yml" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

You will need to rebuild your app with `lando rebuild` to apply the changes to this file. You can check out the full code for this example [over here](https://github.com/lando/lando/tree/master/examples/lemp2).

### Environment Variables

Lando will add some helpful environment variables into your `appserver` so you can get database credential information. These are in addition to the [default variables](./../config/services.md#environment) that we inject into every container. These are accessible via `php`'s [`getenv()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.getenv.php) function.

```bash
DB_HOST=database
DB_USER=lemp
DB_PASSWORD=lemp
DB_NAME=lemp
DB_PORT=3306
```

These are in addition to the [default variables](./../config/services.md#environment) that we inject into every container. Note that these can vary based on the choices you make in your recipe config.

### Automation

You can take advantage of Lando's [events framework](./../config/events.md) to automate common tasks. Here are some useful examples you can drop in your `.lando.yml` to make your LEMP app super slick.

```yml
events:

  # Runs composer install and a custom php script after your app starts
  post-start:
    - appserver: cd $LANDO_MOUNT && composer install
    - appserver: cd $LANDO_WEBROOT && php script.php

```

Advanced Service Usage
----------------------

You can get more in-depth information about the services this recipe provides by running `lando info`.
